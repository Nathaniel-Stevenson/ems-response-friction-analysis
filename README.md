Table: Stage Delay Prevelance by Final Nature

Percentages represent a share of a stage duration that exceeds the overall median. This shows where delays may be found in a given incident type. 

This breakdown is by stage. 

Median time is used for average as it best represents the baseline. Processes likely have a right skewed tail end.
